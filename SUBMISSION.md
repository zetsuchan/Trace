# TRACE — Submission Summary

TRACE is actionable preventative causal intelligence for chronic disease. Instead of telling patients what they already know — that they're in pain — TRACE traces *why*, connecting symptoms across body systems to their biological root causes.

I built this because I have sickle cell disease. A sinoplasty fixed my chronic back pain. No doctor connected sinus inflammation to sickling pain in my spine. TRACE is the tool I needed — one that reasons across systems the way the disease actually moves.

Three Claude agents power a real-time pipeline. Sonnet 4.5 parses natural language symptoms. Opus 4.6 with extended thinking traces causal chains across pathophysiology, autonomously pulling evidence through Exa and FireCrawl MCP tools. A second Sonnet 4.5 agent generates urgency-rated, actionable recommendations.

The UI is designed for patients, not clinicians. Agent outputs render as interactive visual chains — branching cards, animated reveals, and React Flow graphs — so users *see* the causal reasoning instead of reading walls of text. The interface is smooth, mobile-ready, and built on patterns that translate directly to native apps.

Six years of Apple Health data provide personal baselines. The architecture is domain-agnostic — any chronic condition fits the same pipeline.
